On the web I go by many names, but socially I'm known by my real name. <br>
Hi, I'm [Harshit Oberoi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/branch5/)

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast and software engineer who enjoys the challenge of making 
technology both powerful and safe. My journey started with curiosity — breaking things
apart to see how they worked — and grew into a career path where I now focus on building 
systems that are not just functional, but resilient.

I'm especially passionate about cybersecurity because it's like a game of strategy: 
anticipating threats, closing gaps before attackers find them, and staying one step ahead. 
On the software side, I love designing applications that solve real problems, combining 
clean code with secure practices.

When I'm not working on projects, I'm usually exploring new tools, contributing to 
open-source communities, or sharpening my problem-solving skills through capture-the-flag 
challenges, coding exercises, and research. I believe technology is at its best when it's 
reliable, ethical, and accessible — and that's the mindset I bring into every project.

>At the core, I see myself as a builder and protector: someone who creates solutions, 
strengthens systems, and never stops learning.
